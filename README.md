# ONLINE PORTFOLIO (beta version)
This project aims to turn my resume into an online portfolio displaying my formation, professional experiences, skills and projects. I'm looking for an internship from September 2025 to February 2026, and wanted a more 'fun' and extensive way to show my academic journey. A regular version of the resume can still be found at the end of the home page. 
This is still a work in progress but the main functionnalities are already implemented.
I'll keep updating this even after I found an internship to keep trace of the rest of my academic cursus and my projects, this is more a portfolio than an actual resume.
